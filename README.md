## Description
The Book search engine is an application allows users to open personal account, search for and save book data (title, author, description) to their library database from Google's Book API. It is a single page application that uses react and Google Books API to search for and save books to a database.

## Usage
Upon loading the search engine, I am presented with a menu with the options Search for Books and Login/Signup and an input field to search for books and a submit button.
If I am not logged in, I am presented with several search results, each featuring a book’s title, author, description, image, and a link to that book on the Google Books site.
A modal appears on the screen with a toggle between the option to log in or sign up when I click Login/Signup.
To sign up I need to input username, an email address, and a password, and press the signup button
To login I need to input an email address and a password and press the login button.
During logged in to the site, the menu options change to Search for Books, an option to see my saved books, and Logout. Also I can click on the Save button on a book and book’s information is saved to my account. Also i can remove the book by pressing remove button on a book.
Atlast, I can log out by pressing logout button.
